            I would say Masters in Computer Science has been  very challenging and it added up as a strong waitage to my resume. 
            I got to explore lot of things and worked on several research level projects which dealt with real time data. I started my journey in machine learning as well
            working on various projects like single-celled RNA sequencing etc. It was exciting to upgrade myself in order to take up different positions. I'll always
            be proud to be a Xaverian.

            Well this is the place where it all started. This place was and will always be my second home. It's a place
            where I started with baby steps learning about concepts of Scratch and C programming. Then I was exposed to so many different
            technologies including Java, Python, web development, graphic design etc. The list keeps going.
            I have conducted and was involved in many hackathons during my college days. I worked for college as well and contributed to several tech projects which helped it to gain NBA Accredition. Despite of teaching all these It helped me in landing into start up like monocept and MNC like Virtusa in my 4th year. 
            I would honestly say that I gained industry level experience in my bachelor's degree which laid a foundation for me to be a full fledged software engineer.

            I studied Biology, Math, Physics and Chemistry which helped me understand things in a practical manner. That's when I realised Computer Science 
            is my thing. Hence tried hard in getting a seat for my bachelor's

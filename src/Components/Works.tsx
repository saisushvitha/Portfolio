   I started working as a customer service representative during summer break. I work on PC Financial Bank Project. We deal with inbound calls
  for credit cards related queries. This experience helped me more in handling myself during difficult situations. Having lively interactions with 
  clients makes you more confident day by day. I have learned a lot through this job. A valuable experience that makes me stand out of the crowd.

   The founder of this company, Hadi Saad, offered me a job as a full-stack developer(freelancer) at first. Later, with the deadlines
      coming up, I was also involved in developing reports using Power BI, Data integrations etc. I can say these are my first baby steps
      in the field of Bussiness Intelligence. It's when I realized that I could work in multiple domains without any boundaries.

            I loved working here. It's my first MNC company after my bachelor's. Initially, I was taken for a Java Developer role; later on 
            I started working as a UI developer on projects like BT (British Telecommunications), a big client of Virtusa. I had an excellent team
            that involved me in different projects. Hence I had good hands on spring-boot, angular, react ts etc. I have been promoted twice in 2.5 
            years of experience in this company which encouraged me always to be a better version.

         Well, this is the place where it all started. I joined this company at the start of my last semester. It is a startup. I strongly
            feel that my basics are strong because of my experience here. I have always loved working in startups. I was working on their internal
            HR projects. I developed an end-to-end application for them within three months using angular eight and spring boot. All my colleagues of different ages have
            helped me know how the software industry works. It was just a short period, but I learned a lot.
